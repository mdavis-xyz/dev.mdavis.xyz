   What is the Train Game?
</h2>

<i>The Train Game</i> is a maths game to help you pass the time during long train trips.
The aim of the game is to take a number (such as the carriage number on that boring train trip)
and to compose an expression using those digits in order, which equals a target (typically 10).

For example, if the input number is 9302, a solution is \(9 + 3 + 0 - 2 = 10\).
If the number is 4342, a solution is

$$4 \times 3 - \frac{4}{2} = 10$$

Typically the input number is 4 digits long.
Some people play a variation where the digit order may be changed.

For a target of 10, the brute force algorithm (described later)
was used to calculate that 81% of of 4 digit problems are solvable with just addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
To solve the remaining 19% of problems, one must resort to more exotic functions such as logarithms, factorials and trigonometric functions.
For example, a solution for the number 2823 is

$$\left(log_2(8)\right)! -2 + 3! = 10$$
