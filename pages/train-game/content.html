<h2>
   What is the Train Game?
</h2>
<p>
<i>The Train Game</i> is a maths game to help you pass the time during long train trips.
The aim of the game is to take a number (such as the carriage number on that boring train trip)
and to compose an expression using those digits in order, which equals a target (typically 10).
</p>
<p>
For example, the carriage number in this photo is 1802.

<div class="center">
   <img class="niceImage" src="pics/num4-a.jpg" alt="Train Carriage Number" width="563" height="1000">
</div>

One solution for this number is $$1 \times 8 + 0 + 2 = 10$$

Another example is the number 4342, which can be solved with

$$4 \times 3 - \frac{4}{2} = 10$$

</p>
<p>
Typically the input number is 4 digits long.
Some people play a variation where the digit order may be changed.
</p>
<p>
For a target of 10, a brute-force algorithm (described later)
was used to calculate that 81% of of 4 digit problems are solvable with just addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
To solve the remaining 19% of problems, one must resort to more exotic functions such as logarithms, factorials and trigonometric functions.
For example, a solution for the number 2823 is

$$\left(log_2(8)\right)! -2 + 3! = 10$$

<p>
   This tool will solve any train game problem for you.
   You may choose a target other than 10.
   The list of allowed functions can be modified to suit the version you play.
   (Not everyone allows exotic functions.)

<h2>
   How The Solver Works
</h2>

<h3>
   General Approach
</h3>

<p>
For this solver an algorithm was constructed to solve the Train Game using brute force.
When only using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division such a calculation is straightforward.
However if the algorithm considers other functions such as logarithms, factorials and trigonometric functions,
then these functions may be nested to arbitrary depths.
For example, a simple yet poor brute force algorith may try:

<ul>
   <li> \(2+3+4+5 \neq 10\)</li>
   <li> \(\cos(2)+3+4+5 \neq 10\)</li>
   <li> \(\cos(2)!+3+4+5 \neq 10\)</li>
   <li> \(\ln\left(\cos(2)!\right)+3+4+5 \neq 10\)</li>
   <li> \(\tan^{-1}\left(\cos\left(\ln\left(\cos(2)!\right)\right)\right)+3+4+5 \neq 10\)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The set of all possible expressions can be thought of as an infinite dimensional
vector space.
A brute force algorithm must try to exhaustively traverse this space in a <i>breadth-first</i> approach.
, and increases by \(\mathcal{O}\left(e^{n}\right)\) where \(n\) is the number of operations.
</p>
<p>
The algorithm must also consider all possible permutations of brackets.
For a 4 digit number, there are 5 possibilities, which were hard coded.
</p>

<h3>
   Trig Factorial Trick
</h3>

<p>
When solving the Train Game, the presence of a 1 or 0 is very useful.
Zeros can be used to eliminate surplus digits.
For example the problem 5203 can be solved with \(5\times2 + 0\times 3=10\) .
Zeros can also be used to convert any other digit (or expression of digits) to a 1, which is also useful.
For example \(9+(3+6)^0=9+1=10\).
Ones are useful because they can be used to consume undesirable digits.
For example, \(6+4\times\sqrt[2]{1}=6+4=10\).
</p>

<p>
Given these tricks, a method of constructing an expression to transform any digit
into a 1 or 0 would be very helpful for input numbers which lack a 0 or 1 digit.
The following proof by induction proves that \(\sin(n!!)=0\)
and \(\cos(n!!)=1\) for all integers \(n>2\) (when calculating in degrees).
</p>

<p>
\(3!! = 720\) is a multiple of 360. Therefore \(\cos(3!!)=1\) and \(\sin(3!!)=0\) (when using degrees).
</p>

<p>
If \(n!!\) is a multiple of 360, then the following is also a multiple of 360.

$$(n+1)!!=n!!\times\Pi_{m=(n+1)!+1}^{m=(n+1)!}m!$$

Therefore \(\sin((n+1)!!)=0\)
and \(\cos((n+1)!!)=1\).
</p>

<p>
Therefore, by induction, \(\cos(n!!)=1\) and \(\sin(n!!)=0\) for all integers \(n\geq{}3\).
</p>

<p>
This discovery is very valuable for seemingly unsolvable Train Game problems.
For example, the number 7395 can be solved with

$$7+3+\sin\left((9+5)!!\right)=7+3+0=10$$
</p>

<p>
For integers larger than 5, the second factorial is redundant.
It was left in to make the proof simpler.
