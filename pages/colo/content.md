"Colocation" refers to installing batteries and solar (or wind) together at the same site.

When examining the benefits of colocation, many investors, grid operators and policy makers choose a solar project without batteries as the counterfactual.

Given the high upfront cost of batteries, a more suitable counterfactual is that of solar and batteries installed at separate locations, possibly by separate firms.

From this perspective, there are many practical benefits of battery colocation. For example:

- Only one network connection is needed. This matters because grid connections are often scarce, and costly to acquire [(Zhao et al., 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914004668).
- Network charges, charges for ancillary services, and dispatch target deviations due to weather forecast errors can be improved through co-optimising ([Yang et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X21003121), [Ma et al., 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730659)).
- There are efficiencies of scale for project management. e.g. Electricians only need to visit one site to maintain both panels and batteries.
