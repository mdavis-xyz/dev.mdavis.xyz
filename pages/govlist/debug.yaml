  text: Tried to spend $3.3 million on a feasibility study for subsidising a new coal
    generator.  Previous feasibility studies have shown that the project is too risky
    and unprofitable for the private sector. It's also not eligible for the government's
    own Underwriting New Generation Investment program, which is specifically designed
    to deliver new generators with business cases that don't add up, by pushing the
    risk onto taxpayers whilst keeping the profit privatised. The government claimed
    this new generator will reduce power prices for regional Queenslanders, but there
    is only one wholesale electricity price for all of Queensland, and it's already
    50% cheaper than the cost of new coal generation. The company who will build it
    have no relevant experience. The grant criteria was written <i>after</i> the government
    decided that they would give the money to this company.

  text: Introduced a mandatory code of conduct to force companies like Google to pay
    hundreds of millions of dollars to news companies who are struggling due to an
    inability to adapt to the changing classified ads market. Google currently drives
    over 3 billion clicks per year to Australian news companies, thereby <i>increasing</i>
    news company revenue, and in return Google earns only $10 million in advertising
    revenue. This is akin to a local plumber demanding that the Yellow Pages pay the
    plumber for the act of connecting plumber-seeking customers to them. This new
    code also forces Google to give special insider knowledge of proprietary search
    algorithm changes to large news companies, which gives them an unfair advantage
    over small, independent journalists. It includes ambiguously written clauses about
    giving news companies access to Google users' private data. It is written based
    on incorrect assumptions, such as assuming news makes up 10% of searches when
    it's only 1%.

    When law enforcement unlock a device after demanding a password, they typically
    don't let the user see what was done, don't tell them what was done, and don't
    allow them to call a lawyer to find out their rights. In one case a Border Force
    officer looked through a series of nude photographs of someone's partner, without
    the consent of the user or person in the photo, made inappropriate comments, and
    possibly made nonconsentual copies of the photos. If a citizen not suspected of
    a crime withholds a password to prevent this, they'll be fined.

    allow international companies to sue governments if their profits are diminished
    by environmental, indigenous land rights or anti-child-sweatshop laws. The TPP
    would give corporations many of the same rights that individuals have. There is
    no expiration date or separation clause, so once signed, it's here forever.
