# Since Coalition ministers have a habit of suing everyone online for defamation,
# I should probably clarify:
# A tag of "corruption" is not an allegation that the person committed a corruption crime.
# It may just be something related to corruption (e.g. voting against ICAC)
# or may be that someone did something which *should* be illegal, but is not.

    Spent $5 million building a water pipeline underwater,
    to supply a privately owned golf course in a city,
    using funds that were supposed to be spent on sustainability and regional communities.
    Personal conflicts of interest were not declared, which violates the ministerial code of conduct.

    in the same month they claimed they'll solve climate change with "‘can do’ capitalism, not ‘don’t do’ governments".
    The government say they want to intervene with tax money to prop up coal instead,
    despite also saying their climate change plan is to <i>not</i> intervene in markets with taxpayer money.

    Spent $450 million on carbon capture and storage projects (CCS),
    resulting in every attempted project being cancelled or late, with no carbon actually being captured,
    mostly because the projects were found to be technically infeasible, financially infeasible, or there just isn't anywhere to store the carbon.
    The government did not attempt to monitor whether the program successfully captured carbon.
    Their only success criteria was number of projects funded, regardless of whether the projects work.
    Even by this measure it was a failure because the committed money ($2 billion) ended up mostly unspent due to project cancellations.
    The spending program had no conflict of interest safeguards.
    Coincidentally one of the main Liberal ministers pushing for this cash handout to the fossil fuel industry left parliament for a job as a lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry.

    The government contributed $50M to this project which cost $500M overall, to produce only 3 tonnes of hydrogen.

    Introduced a bill which they called the "anti-trolling" bill, which doesn't even mention trolling.
    It does not make trolling illegal.
    It does not give social media companies the power to remove defamatory or troll content.
    The bill means that moderators of Facebook pages no longer have an obligation to take down troll content, which will help trolling, not hinder it.
    What this new red tape does do is make it easier to sue social media companies for defamation when their users post mean things.
    Social media companies may still be sued even if their failure to notice the material was not due to negligence.
    The main change is that social media companies need a way to name accused anonymous users, but the accused users will be allowed to just say 'no'.
    The powers can only be used if a defamation case is likely (i.e. only for people with a spare $20k lying around), which means this bill won't reduce school-age cyber bullying.
    The government themselves already hide behind anonymous online accounts to defame political opponents.
    These changes violate our existing free trade agreements.

    The argument is that if you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to hide.
    Powers include removing two factor authentication on accounts, thereby making it easier for unrelated criminals to hack those Australians.

This is supposed to make it easier for investors to track company directors as they move between companies. However the name, address, date and place of birth of directors is already recorded in a public database, which will be <i>replaced</i> with this new single 15-digit number. This attempt at transparency actually reduces the amount of information available to the public.

    Previous feasibility studies have shown that the project is too risky and unprofitable for the private sector.
    It's also not eligible for the government's own Underwriting New Generation Investment program.
    The government claimed this new generator will reduce power prices for regional Queenslanders specifically,
    but there is only one wholesale electricity price for all of Queensland,
    and it's already 50% cheaper than the cost of new coal generation.
