                  Threatened queer detainees in PNG by saying they will be reported to local police if they engage in homosexual acts. Homosexuality is illegal in PNG. Such threats mean refugees fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation are not able to make their asylum claim without fear of arrest. This counts as human rights abuse because it violates the principle of non-refoulement and strips people of their right to safely make a claim for asylum. The government has refused to comment further.

                  Deregulated university fees, thereby allowing Universities to charge what they want. Students will end up with American levels of crippling debt. Many of the politicians behind this policy received their degrees for free. Average student debt is expected to rise to $100,000, even though Abbott himself said "it is irresponsible to saddle Australians with $25,000 of debt".

                  Gave state governments an ultimatum: sell off government assets before a certain deadline, (regardless of whether the people or the state government want to) or miss out on billions of dollars of funding. This includes selling NSW's 'poles and wires' for only $3-5 billion, even though they generate over $1.5 billion per year for the government. The states would not be allowed to use the money from the sales to pay off debt. Reluctant states were told they could still access federal funds through environmental programs that the Federal Government is trying to scrap.

                  Threatened queer detainees in PNG by saying they will be reported to local police if they engage in homosexual acts. Homosexuality is illegal in PNG. Such threats mean refugees fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation are not able to make their asylum claim without fear of arrest. This counts as human rights abuse because it violates the principle of non-refoulement and strips people of their right to safely make a claim for asylum. The government has refused to comment further.

                  Accidentally published personal details about almost 10,000 asylum seekers and their claims, thereby putting all their lives in danger. Regardless of whether the original asylum claims were genuine, if those asylum seekers are returned to their country of origin, they and their family may be imprisoned, tortured or killed because governments and militias in their country of origin will know they sought asylum. As part of a press release about the accidental leak, the government made public further information about where to find the still life threatening document.

                  Gave state governments an ultimatum: sell off government assets before a certain deadline, (regardless of whether the people or the state government want to) or miss out on billions of dollars of funding. This includes selling NSW's 'poles and wires' for only $3-5 billion, even though they generate over $1.5 billion per year for the government. The states would not be allowed to use the money from the sales to pay off debt. Reluctant states were told they could still access federal funds through environmental programs that the Federal Government is trying to scrap.
