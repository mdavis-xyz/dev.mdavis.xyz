Refused to refer to East Jerusalem as "occupied", even though the Israeli military has met the specific criteria which constitute the legal definition of occupation, and even though Israel's own highest court ruled that the region is occupied, and even though the Israelis have build a wall twice as tall as the Berlin wall to separate the region from the rest of Palestine. {http://youtu.be/9W7ZhGFwz6g}#international

Refused to publish any submissions it received for or against the proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act, even though the government says the changes are to protect free speech.

Such requests may be denied. {https://newmatilda.com/2014/06/20/brandis-blocks-public-airing-free-speech-submissions}{http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/How_to_make_a_submission}#transparency
