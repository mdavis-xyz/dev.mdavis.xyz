A company called [Lime](https://www.li.me/) recently launched an e-bike rental scheme in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Think about Samsung's spontaneously combusting Galaxy Note 7 phones.
An e-bike battery is about 100 times larger than a phone battery.
So imagine sitting on a pile of 100 of those Galaxy Note 7 phones.
That's how much potential there is for things to go wrong with e-bikes.

If you get injured by a Lime bike battery because of bad luck, incompetence, negligence of even outright malice by Lime, you can't take any legal action against them.
This is because their terms and conditions grant them immunity from all laws, statutes, rules, regulations and constitutions.
(Section [2.3](2.3), [12.3.3](12.3.3) of their terms, and many others, listed below.)
By agreeing to their villainous terms and conditions, users give away the right to class actions, as well as individual legal actions, and even arbitration.
Class actions allow people to group together to take action against a company who through incompetence or malice systematically harmed people.
When the possibility of class action and individual actions are taken away, companies have a far smaller incentive to avoid to the wrong thing.
Lime says you still have the possibility of arbitration, but that's [not true](2.4) for people outside the US.
Lime are still are able to [take you to court](2.7) though.


Lime's terms and conditions are longer than my honours thesis.
Large chunks are not at all applicable to Lime bikes.
I suspect the terms are so extreme that it's possibly illegal.
My favourite clauses are:

* They can switch on your phone's camera and microphone without your knowledge. Or they can install a hidden camera in the bike, then do whatever they want with that media, without even notifying you. For example, they can take up-skirt photos and post them on Pornhub. (Section [12.8](12.8), [6.2.10](6.2.10))
* They're allowed to install malware and [cryptojackers](https://www.coindesk.com/new-crypto-mining-malware-seen-to-evolve-say-researchers) on your phone. If they hijack your phone's Internet connection to download child porn or other illegal media, you cannot take legal action against them. (Sections [6.2.5](6.2.5), [8.1](8.1))
* If someone else is hurt by a malfunction with the bike you're riding (such as poorly maintained brakes causing a collision) *you* will be liable for that other person's injury. (Sections [6.2](6.2), [7.4.5](7.4.5) and others)
* You know those stories about bakers refusing to make cakes for same sex weddings? Six different clauses all give Lime the right to discriminate against you based on sexual orientation, skin colour, political opinion and so on. (They phrase this as refusing service "for any reason".) They're also allowed to trawl through your social media profiles to obtain this information. (Sections [4.1](4.1), [9.2](9.2), [10.2](10.2), [12.13](12.13), [12.19](12.19), [12.23](12.23))  
* iPhone users aren't allowed to use the app in a "Terrorist supporting country", but Android users are! (Section [12.28](12.28))
* If Lime maliciously rigs the bike battery to deliberately explode and murder you, you and your heirs are not able to take any legal action against them. (Sections [2.3](2.3), [2.8](2.8), [5.1](5.1), [6.1](6.1), [6.2](6.2), [7.4](7.4), [7.4.5](7.4.5),  [12.3.3](12.3.3)) Hopefully the courts would rule those clauses as invalid. However that fact that this is what their terms say is worrying.
* Users aren't allowed to mention the word "Lime" in any email, tweet, WhatsApp message or other online channel (even private), since that's an online usage of their trademark without permission. Uploading a photo to Instagram which happens to have a Lime bike in the background is a violation (Section [12.8](12.8))
* By merely installing the app you are technically violating the terms and conditions. You've copied their "content" to non-temporary storage on your device. That's not allowed. (Section [12.8](12.8))
* If you alert them to a safety issue with their bikes, they have no obligation to fix them. (Section [6.2.10](6.2.10))
* Users and their family aren't allowed to take unrelated legal action against anyone who happens to work for Lime, even if the issue is unrelated to lime. (Section [5.1](5.1))
* Users agree to read the entire 30,000-word terms and conditions every time they ride. (Section [12.25.5](12.25.5))
* The terms and conditions are obsessed with copyright, which is just very strange for a company that rents out bicycles. They even have DMCA [takedown](https://boingboing.net/2012/12/18/how-victorias-secret-censore.html) clauses, and you give them control over your "content" "in perpetuity and throughout the universe". (Sections [12.1](12.1), [12.24](12.24)) It's not clear what "content" is for a bike rental company where users cannot post anything on their website.
* They can blatantly lie about the price. They can tell you one price then charge you another (Sections [4.9](4.9), [6.2.6](6.2.6))
* Section [4.9](4.9) says that "If a product You purchased from Lime is not as described, Your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging." Users acquire their bikes by finding them without any packaging, on the side of the street. This clause is not applicable, and is the first hint that this entire document was blindly copied and pasted from a template for an unrelated industry. (The entirety of [Section 12](12) is the other hint.)
* The app has a map with icons of their available bikes. [Section 4.10](4.10) says they can put fictitious icons on the map which don't match a real bike, to mislead the users into thinking they have more bikes than they do. ([Section 6.2.6](6.2.6), 4.10) For context, this is what [Uber already does](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uber-cars-always-in-real-time).
* They can send you robocall spam, even if your number is on the Do Not Call list, and even after you close your account. ([Section 11.3](11.3)) They can send you email and phone calls from email addresses and phone numbers you didn't give them, which they get from "other means". ([Section 11.4](11.4))
* If their GPS tracking is inaccurate and as a result they can't find the bike,  they may report you as a thief to the cops. ([Section 12.2](12.2))
* Lime "makes no representation that the service is applicable or available or use outside the USA". However Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are listed on their website on their ["Locations" page](https://www.li.me/locations). ([Section 12.23](12.23))
* Lime have no obligation to keep your personal information (including credit card info) secure. (Sections [4.11](4.11), [6.2.4](6.2.4))
* If they charge you an incorrect amount (such as $1,000,000 for one ride) and it takes you more than 60 days to notice, there's nothing you can do to get a refund. ([Section 4.4](4.4))
* If you forget to lock the bike,  you can be charged 600 USD. ([Section 3.3](3.3))

I am not a lawyer.
I suspect that many of the claims are legally invalid.
Some consumer rights are inalienable.
For example, many "no refunds" policies [do not](https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/harvey-norman-franchisees-pay-for-misleading-consumers) take away your right to a refund.
However you would have to take Lime to court to find out which terms hold up judicial scrutiny.
 It's also unclear how the laws work across countries.
Australia has far stronger consumer protections than the US, however the terms say that you give up Australian laws and agree to be bound by US laws.
I am not sure if that's legally valid.
Lime did not respond to my questions. ([Section 12.23](12.23) of terms and conditions say they are not obliged to reply.)

I am not alleging that Lime have committed any bad acts, only that their terms say that they can. That is still bad.
If someone points a loaded gun at you and promises not to shoot, would you feel safe?


Lime's terms and conditions can be found [here](https://www.li.me/user-agreement) ([Internet Archive copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20181129080036/https://www.li.me/user-agreement)).

[4.9](4.9)  If a product You purchased from Lime is not as described, Your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging. - huh? Packaging? Did they copy and paste from some other company?

[12.8](12.8) - seems not applicable. By downloading the app to non-temporary storage, you're violating the agreement. I saved the terms and conditions to Pocket so that I could read them later (because they're so long). That's a violation.

[12.9](12.9) also not applicable. It's for an online media company

[12.10](12.10) can't use Lime's trademark in any way. A thumbnail on an article, photo of a public space which happens to show a logo on the bike, a tweet mentioning the name "Lime" are all violations, unless you get their explicit consent.

[12.12](12.12) also about user submissions to the website, which isn't applicable

* They ignore do not track and make a factually incorrect statement about that standard not being finalised

* You have the right to be forgotten
* You have the right to export your data in a common machine readable format
