     - h1: No, you don't need a blockchain
     - p: Blockchains are like a normal database, but deliberately slow to allow many parties to write without a central authority.
     - p: If one party has the power to overwrite other data then you have a centralised authority. So there's no point using a blockchain.

     - h1: No, you don't need a blockchain
     - p: The reason blockchains were invented was to create an <i>immutable</i> database. This means that data written to it cannot be deleted.
     - p: The only way you can modify a true blockchain is to convince everyone using it to instead use a new amended copy, and ignore the old copy. This is called a <a target="_blank" href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/the-dao/">soft fork</a>. This requires a lot of effort, and involves convincing a large community (who are not all trustworthy) to throw away the cherished immutability property of blockchains.
     - p: The unique value proposition of blockchains is that they are immutable. If you want to overwrite data then you do not want immutability. So just use a normal database.
