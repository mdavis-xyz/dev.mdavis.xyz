     - p: Blockchains are no better at verifying things in the real world than any other database.
     - p: The hard part of verification is converting attributes of physical things into bytes. Blockchains cannot bridge the cyberspace-meatspace interface. They just take the bytes they're given and put them on hard drives, slowly.

This is called a <a target="_blank" href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/the-dao/">soft fork</a>. This requires a lot of effort, and involves convincing a large community (who are not all trustworthy) to throw away the cherished immutability property of blockchains.
