      Rental and Use of Vehicles.
      (a) Use and Operation of Vehicles. You certify and expressly agree that
      You are the sole renter, and will be the sole driver, of the Vehicle.
      You may not allow others to operate the Vehicle that You have activated.
      You agree to follow all laws pertaining to the use, riding and
      operation of the Vehicles (e.g., traffic laws, parking restrictions,
      seatbelt and child safety seat laws, alcohol and drug use). You agree
      that the Vehicles are the exclusive property of Lime, and you may not
      tamper with, modify, repair, apply any form of decal or sticker to, or
      deface any Vehicle (or any part thereof) in any way. Lime, or its third
      party contractors, monitors the location, charge and fuel status,
      odometer and other driving information of the Vehicle, and may collect
      information and data regarding your use of the Vehicle. You agree and
      acknowledge that Vehicles may not be available at all times.
      (b)  Pick-up; Drop-off. Maximum rental time of a Vehicle is 24 hours.
      You agree that You will deactivate the Vehicle rental within 24 hours
      after that rental began. You may then rent again. When you are finished
      with the Vehicle, you simply return it to any legal parking space within
      the approved area of use (which can be found in your App). You agree
      that You are solely responsible for being aware of any elapsed time
      related to timely deactivating any Vehicle. The maximum charge is based
      on a 24-hour period pursuant to the pricing set forth in the App. After
      return of the Vehicle, You will be charged the accumulated rental
      charges, or the maximum 24-hour charge, whichever is less. Vehicles not
      returned within 48 hours will be considered lost or stolen, and a police
      report may be filed against You. We reserve the right to take any other
      action needed and permitted by law, including holding you liable for
      the value of the Vehicle.
      (c) Prohibited Conduct. You agree that you will not use the Vehicles:
      (i) on any unpaved roads or in any location where their use is
      prohibited or illegal; (ii) for racing or stunts; (iii) for commercial
      purposes, such as rideshare, food delivery or advertising services; (iv)
      while conducting any activities (including using any cellular telephone
      or text messaging device) that may distract You from safely operating
      the Vehicle; (v) while under the influence of alcohol, drugs,
      medication, or any other substance that may impair Your ability to
      safely operate the Vehicle; (vi) to tow or haul any trailers or other
      vehicles, or to carry cargo over 600 pounds; or (vii) in any manner that
      violates applicable law and/or in the commision of any crime.
      (d) Damage; Vandalism; Lost Items. You agree to return the Vehicle to
      Lime in the same condition in which such Vehicle was rented, normal wear
      and tear excluded. You agree that you will be responsible for the cost
      of repairing and replacing any Vehicle that you damage or cause damage
      to. You may also be responsible for the cost of cleaning any Vehicle if
      Your use was beyond normal wear and tear (for example, smoking is not
      allowed in any Vehicle and may incur a cleaning cost). If you vandalize
      any Vehicle, you shall be liable for all costs of repair or replacement.
      Other costs that You may be responsible for are those that result from
      Your failure to lock the Vehicle during or after Your rental, and/or if
      the Vehicle was towed as a result of Your actions. Lime is not
      responsible for loss of or damage to Your property or the property of
      others left at any time in or on any Vehicle or on Lime's premises. Lime
      may hold lost items for up to 90 days or as otherwise required by law.
      (e) Reporting of Damage or Crashes. You must report any accident, crash,
      damage, personal injury, stolen or lost Vehicle to Lime as soon as
      possible. If a crash involves personal injury, property damage or a
      stolen Vehicle, you must file a report with the local police department
      within 24 hours.

      and/or any other charges incurred by Lime that result from your parking
      any Vehicle improperly, or as a result of your violating any law, rule,

      acknowledge that we cooperate with all federal, state, municipal and
      local officials charged with enforcing infractions to provide any
      information necessary as they may request or may otherwise be required.
      You authorize Lime to bill you directly to the credit/debit card and/or
      other payment method on file with Your account. You authorize us to
      contact You directly regarding any tickets, citations, fines and/or
      penalties incurred by You or assessed against Lime or the Vehicle while
      the Vehicle was rented to You. In the event we use a third party
      collection and/or administrative agent to resolve any tickets,
      citations, fines and/or penalties, You agree to pay all costs and
      collection fees including, but not limited to, administrative and legal
      costs to such agent upon demand without protest. We may also charge a
      reasonable service fee for rentals in excess of 24 hours where the
      Vehicle is not considered lost or stolen.

      The level of charging power in the E-vehicle at the time You initiate

      <u>Binding Arbitration</u>
      : If We cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 2 (or agree to
      arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within
      sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, LAW, STATUTE,

      OF THIS AGREEMENT, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
      THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR
      ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE PROVISION OR USE OF THE SERVICES. The
      Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), not state law, shall govern the
      arbitrability of all Disputes regarding this
      Agreement (and any Additional Terms) and the Services, including the
      “No Class Action Matters” Section below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH
      PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD
      BY A JUDGE OR JURY. Lime and You agree, however, that State or federal
      law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or
      causes of action, remedies, and damages arising from a Dispute
      regarding this Agreement and the Services, whether arising or stated in

      <u>Applicability of JAMS Rules and Location of Arbitration</u>
      : A Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in
      accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
      Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) using JAMS’
      streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other
      arbitration administration service that You and an officer or legal
      representative of Lime consent to in writing. If an in-person
      arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the
      “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau)
      where You are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to
      arbitration. You and Lime will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s
      fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration
      rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Lime to pay
      a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this
      Section 2 to be enforceable, then Lime will have the right to elect to
      pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator or
      arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply and be bound by this
      Agreement and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute
      according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no
      other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. All issues are for the
      arbitrator to decide, including arbitrability. This arbitration
      provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or the Services.
      You can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:

      entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The
      Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of
      the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
      warranted by the claimant's individual claim. The Arbitrator’s decision
      shall be final and binding on all parties. The prevailing party in the
      arbitration shall be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs,
      as long as the Arbitrator includes such an award of attorneys’ fees and
      costs in the written decision.

      and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or

      party. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be
      arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes
      brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
      public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for
      any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this
      restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in
      Section 2 to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought
      exclusively in court. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
      Section 2, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and
      enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein
      (described in this “No Class Action Matters” section), are to be
      decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the
      arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class
      action waiver provisions.

      from Subscription Term to Subscription Term due to changes in Your
      subscription plan or applicable taxes, and You authorize Lime to charge
      Your payment method for these amounts. Lime reserves the right to
      change the pricing of subscription at any time. In the event of a price
      change, Lime will post the new pricing on the Services and attempt to

      subscription as described below, otherwise You will be deemed to have
      consented to the price/subscription package change and authorize Lime

      discrepancies in billing, You hereby waive Your right to dispute such
      discrepancies if You do not notify Lime within sixty (60) days after

      Membership." There are no refunds or credits for partial months.
      Cancellation of initial membership any time after purchase will result

      personal or business checks or any other payment form, although in the
      future We may change this policy. Your Card issuer agreement governs
      Your use of Your designated Card, and You must refer to that agreement
      and not this Agreement to determine Your rights and liabilities as a
      cardholder. You represent and warrant that You will not use any Card or

      You agree that they will be deemed accepted by You for all purposes. If
      Lime does not receive payment from Your Card issuer or its agent, You
      agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Lime or its agents. Sales
      taxes, or other taxes, customs, import/export charges, or similar
      governmental charges are not included in the price of the products. You

      localities that it deems is required in accordance with our order
      policy in effect at the time of purchase.

      confirmation of our offer to sell. Lime reserves the right at any time
      after receipt of Your order to accept or decline Your order for any
      reason. Lime further reserves the right any time after receipt of Your
      order, without prior notice to You, to supply less than the quantity
      You ordered of any item. Your order will be deemed accepted by Lime
      upon our delivery of Products and/or Services that You have ordered. We
      may require additional verifications or information before accepting
      any order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You agree that, if We cancel
      all or a portion of Your order or if We provide You less than the
      quantity You ordered, Your sole and exclusive remedy is either that:
      (a) We will issue a credit to Your Card account in the amount charged
      for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if Your Card
      has already been charged for the order); or (b) We will not charge Your
      Card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not
      provided. Do not assume that a cancellation or change of an order You
      have placed with Lime has been effected until You receive a
      confirmation from Lime via email or the Services. As stated above, You
      will be responsible for, and Your Card or third-party payment account
      may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders
      already processed or shipped before Your cancellation/change request or
      a request to terminate Your account was received.
