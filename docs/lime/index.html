               Disclaimer: I am not legally qualified. This is a layman's interpretation of Lime's terms, not legal advice. I'm not alleging that they have committed any unethical acts, only that their terms and conditions allow them to.

      <hr/>
      <p>A company called <a href="https://www.li.me/">Lime</a> recently launched an e-bike rental scheme in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.</p>
<p>Think about Samsung's spontaneously combusting Galaxy Note 7 phones. An e-bike battery is about 100 times larger than a phone battery. So imagine sitting on a pile of 100 of those Galaxy Note 7 phones. That's how much potential there is for things to go wrong with e-bikes.</p>
<p>If you get injured by a Lime bike battery because of bad luck, incompetence, negligence of even outright malice by Lime, you can't take any legal action against them. This is because their terms and conditions grant them immunity from all laws, statutes, rules, regulations and constitutions. (Section <a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.3.')">2.3</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.3.3.')">12.3.3</a> of their terms, and many others, listed below.) By agreeing to their villainous terms and conditions, users give away the right to class actions, as well as individual legal actions, and even arbitration. Class actions allow people to group together to take action against a company who through incompetence or malice systematically harmed people. When the possibility of class action and individual actions are taken away, companies have a far smaller incentive to avoid to the wrong thing. Lime says you still have the possibility of arbitration, but that's <a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.4.')">not true</a> for people outside the US. Lime are still are able to <a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.7.')">take you to court</a> though.</p>
<p>Lime's terms and conditions are longer than my honours thesis. Large chunks are not at all applicable to Lime bikes. I suspect the terms are so extreme that it's possibly illegal. My favourite clauses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can switch on your phone's camera and microphone without your knowledge. Or they can install a hidden camera in the bike, then do whatever they want with that media, without even notifying you. For example, they can take up-skirt photos and post them on Pornhub. (Section <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.8.')">12.8</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.10.')">6.2.10</a>)</li>
<li>They're allowed to install malware and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-crypto-mining-malware-seen-to-evolve-say-researchers">cryptojackers</a> on your phone. If they hijack your phone's Internet connection to download child porn or other illegal media, you cannot take legal action against them. (Sections <a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.5.')">6.2.5</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('8.1.')">8.1</a>)</li>
<li>If someone else is hurt by a malfunction with the bike you're riding (such as poorly maintained brakes causing a collision) <em>you</em> will be liable for that other person's injury. (Sections <a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.')">6.2</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('7.4.5.')">7.4.5</a> and others)</li>
<li>You know those stories about bakers refusing to make cakes for same sex weddings? Six different clauses all give Lime the right to discriminate against you based on sexual orientation, skin colour, political opinion and so on. (They phrase this as refusing service &quot;for any reason&quot;.) They're also allowed to trawl through your social media profiles to obtain this information. (Sections <a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.1.')">4.1</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('9.2.')">9.2</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('10.2.')">10.2</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.13.')">12.13</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.19.')">12.19</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">12.23</a>)<br />
</li>
<li>iPhone users aren't allowed to use the app in a &quot;Terrorist supporting country&quot;, but Android users are! (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.28.')">Section 12.28</a>)</li>
<li>If Lime maliciously rigs the bike battery to deliberately explode and murder you, you and your heirs are not able to take any legal action against them. (Sections <a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.3.')">2.3</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.8.')">2.8</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('5.1.')">5.1</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.1.')">6.1</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.')">6.2</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('7.4.')">7.4</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('7.4.5.')">7.4.5</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.3.3.')">12.3.3</a>) Hopefully the courts would rule those clauses as invalid. However that fact that this is what their terms say is worrying.</li>
<li>Users aren't allowed to mention the word &quot;Lime&quot; in any email, tweet, WhatsApp message or other online channel (even private), since that's an online usage of their trademark without permission. Uploading a photo to Instagram which happens to have a Lime bike in the background is a violation (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.8.')">Section 12.8</a>)</li>
<li>By merely installing the app you are technically violating the terms and conditions. You've copied their &quot;content&quot; to non-temporary storage on your device. That's not allowed. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.8.')">Section 12.8</a>)</li>
<li>If you alert them to a safety issue with their bikes, they have no obligation to fix them. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.10.')">Section 6.2.10</a>)</li>
<li>Users and their family aren't allowed to take unrelated legal action against anyone who happens to work for Lime, even if the issue is unrelated to lime. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('5.1.')">Section 5.1</a>)</li>
<li>Users agree to read the entire 30,000-word terms and conditions every time they ride. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.25.5.')">Section 12.25.5</a>)</li>
<li>The terms and conditions are obsessed with copyright, which is just very strange for a company that rents out bicycles. They even have DMCA <a href="https://boingboing.net/2012/12/18/how-victorias-secret-censore.html">takedown</a> clauses, and you give them control over your &quot;content&quot; &quot;in perpetuity and throughout the universe&quot;. (Sections <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.1.')">12.1</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.24.')">12.24</a>) It's not clear what &quot;content&quot; is for a bike rental company where users cannot post anything on their website.</li>
<li>They can blatantly lie about the price. They can tell you one price then charge you another (Sections <a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.9.')">4.9</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.6.')">6.2.6</a>)</li>
<li><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.9.')">Section 4.9</a> says that &quot;If a product You purchased from Lime is not as described, Your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging.&quot; Users acquire their bikes by finding them without any packaging, on the side of the street. This clause is not applicable, and is the first hint that this entire document was blindly copied and pasted from a template for an unrelated industry. (The entirety of <a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.')">Section 12</a> is the other hint.)</li>
<li>The app has a map with icons of their available bikes. <a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.10.')">Section 4.10</a> says they can put fictitious icons on the map which don't match a real bike, to mislead the users into thinking they have more bikes than they do. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.6.')">Section 6.2.6</a>, 4.10) For context, this is what <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uber-cars-always-in-real-time">Uber already does</a>.</li>
<li>They can send you robocall spam, even if your number is on the Do Not Call list, and even after you close your account. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('11.3.')">Section 11.3</a>) They can send you email and phone calls from email addresses and phone numbers you didn't give them, which they get from &quot;other means&quot;. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('11.4.')">Section 11.4</a>)</li>
<li>If their GPS tracking is inaccurate and as a result they can't find the bike, they may report you as a thief to the cops. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.2.')">Section 12.2</a>)</li>
<li>Lime &quot;makes no representation that the service is applicable or available or use outside the USA&quot;. However Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are listed on their website on their <a href="https://www.li.me/locations">&quot;Locations&quot; page</a>. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">Section 12.23</a>)</li>
<li>Lime have no obligation to keep your personal information (including credit card info) secure. (Sections <a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.11.')">4.11</a>, <a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.4.')">6.2.4</a>)</li>
<li>If they charge you an incorrect amount (such as $1,000,000 for one ride) and it takes you more than 60 days to notice, there's nothing you can do to get a refund. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.4.')">Section 4.4</a>)</li>
<li>If you forget to lock the bike, you can be charged 600 USD. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('3.3.')">Section 3.3</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not a lawyer. I suspect that many of the claims are legally invalid, because some consumer rights are inalienable. For example, many &quot;no refunds&quot; policies <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/harvey-norman-franchisees-pay-for-misleading-consumers">do not</a> take away your right to a refund. However you would have to take Lime to court to find out which terms hold up judicial scrutiny. It's also unclear how the laws work across countries. Australia has far stronger consumer protections than the US, however the terms say that you give up Australian laws and agree to be bound by US laws. I am not sure if that's legally valid. Lime did not respond to my questions. (<a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">Section 12.23</a> of their terms and conditions say they are not obliged to reply.)</p>
<p>I am not alleging that Lime have committed any bad acts, only that their terms say that they can. That is still bad. If someone points a loaded gun at you and promises not to shoot, would you feel safe?</p>
<h2 id="the-full-list">The Full List</h2>
<h3 id="terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Lime's terms and conditions can be found <a href="https://www.li.me/user-agreement">here</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181129080036/https://www.li.me/user-agreement">Internet Archive copy</a>).</p>
<p>Here is a list of all the notable terms and conditions:</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.3.')">Section 2.3</a> states (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any and all disputes arising between you and Lime (whether based in contract, <strong>law, statute</strong>, rule, regulation, ordinance, tort including, but not limited to, fraud, any other intentional tort or <strong>negligence, common law, constitutional provision</strong>, respondeat superior, agency and/or any other legal or equitable theory), whether arising before or after the effective date of this agreement, <strong>must be resolved by final and binding arbitration</strong>. This includes any and all disputes based on any product, service or advertising connected to the provision or use of the services ... by agreeing to arbitrate, each party is giving up its right to go to court and have any dispute heard by a judge or jury</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first clause which removes your right to take Lime to court if they are negligent, incompetent or malicious. Arbitration means that instead of having your case heard in a court of law with a jury of peers, your case is heard in a corporate-friendly kangaroo court.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.4.')">2.4</a> Arbitration will be conducted in the &quot;metropolitan statistical area&quot; (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where You are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. So if you're an Australian, you can't even have an arbitration hearing.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.4.')">2.4</a> more protection against class action: &quot;The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.6.')">2.6</a> 1 year state of limitations (for the user, not for Lime)</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.7.')">2.7</a> You can't take them to court, but they can still take you to court</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.7.')">2.7</a> they're obsessed with their intellectual property.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('2.8.')">2.8</a> &quot;YOU AND LIME AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. &quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('3.2.')">3.2</a> &quot;Lime reserves the right to modify or cancel Discounts at any time&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('3.3.')">3.3</a> if you forget the lock the bike you can be charged $600 (USD?)</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.1.')">4.1</a> if you pay for a monthly or yearly membership, they can cancel it at any time without refunding you, for any reason. i.e. they can cancel your membership with 364 days remaining just because they don't like your skin colour or your religion. (There's another clause which says they can monitor your social media)</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.3.')">4.3</a> &quot;PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A NOTICE FROM US THAT YOUR FREE TRIAL HAS ENDED OR THAT THE PAID PORTION OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE FREE TRIALS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT NOTICE AND IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.4.')">4.4</a> &quot;billing errors have a statute of limitations of 60 days&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.7.')">4.7</a> they have no obligation to refund, even if the bike is faulty</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.8.')">4.8</a> an order confirmation doesn't confirm that they accept your order. They can reject your valid order after the order is confirmed, for any reason</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.9.')">4.9</a> We do not warrant that specifications or pricing on the Services is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.9.')">4.9</a> If a product You purchased from Lime is not as described, Your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging. - huh? Packaging? Did they copy and paste from some other company?</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.10.')">4.10</a> grants them the right to put false bike icons on the map</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.11.')">4.11</a> if your legal name sounds fake, they can refuse service</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.11.')">4.11</a> They have no obligation to store your password securely. &quot;You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of Your password and account&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('4.11.')">4.11</a> Please note that anyone able to provide Your personally identifiable information will be able to access Your account so You should take reasonable steps to protect this information</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('5.1.')">5.1</a> you and your family cannot take legal action against anyone associated with Lime, even action unrelated to Lime.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('5.2.')">5.2</a> what does this even mean? &quot;You expressly agree and acknowledge that You may discover facts or law different from, or in addition to, the facts or law that You know or believe to be true with respect to the Claims and the Released Persons&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.1.')">6.1</a> they don't claim their products are fit for purpose</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.')">6.2</a> if their bikes are designed hazardously, they're not at fault. You bear all risk</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.4.')">6.2.4</a> they have no obligation to protect your data (PII or credit card info)</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.5.')">6.2.5</a> they grant themselves the right to install malware or cryptojackers with their app.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.6.')">6.2.6</a> any claims they make about their service can be lies</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.7.')">6.2.7</a> they don't have to correct lies you call out, nor product faults, including safety issues</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('6.2.10.')">6.2.10</a> another clause allowing them to install malware</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('7.4.')">7.4</a> any injuries they cause are not their fault</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('7.4.4.')">7.4.4</a> you agree to wear the helmet according to the manufacturers instructions. What are those instructions?</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('7.4.5.')">7.4.5</a> if the bike bursts into flames and destroys property or kills someone, you're liable</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('8.1.')">8.1</a> they're allowed to transmit anything illegal from your device out to the internet - information or material transmitted through Your Device(s), even if not submitted by You, that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('9.2.')">9.2</a> yet another clause allowing them to terminate your account for any reason, including discrimination</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('10.2.')">10.2</a> You can't take them to court, but they can take you to court</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('10.2.')">10.2</a> they can discriminate against you by terminating your account</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('11.3.')">11.3</a> they can send you robocall spam, even if your number is on the do not call list, even after you close your account. So they mist not delete your data then. They claim giving a phone number is optional, but is it?</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('11.4.')">11.4</a> they can send you email and phone calls when you didn't give then that contact info, but they got it by &quot;other means&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('11.4.')">11.4</a> ask them what does &quot;immediately&quot; mean</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.2.')">12.2</a> if their GPS tracking is inaccurate and they can't find the bike, they'll report you as a thief to the cops</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.3.3.')">12.3.3</a> if you die, they're not liable</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.7.')">12.7</a> they can switch on your phone's camera and microphone without your knowledge, or install a hidden camera in the bike, then do whatever they want with that media, without even notifying you. Even upskirt shots?</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.8.')">12.8</a> - seems not applicable. By downloading the app to non-temporary storage, you're violating the agreement. I saved the terms and conditions to Pocket so that I could read them later (because they're so long). That's a violation.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.9.')">12.9</a> also not applicable. It's for an online media company</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.10.')">12.10</a> can't use Lime's trademark in any way. A thumbnail on an article, photo of a public space which happens to show a logo on the bike, a tweet mentioning the name &quot;Lime&quot; are all violations, unless you get their explicit consent.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.11.')">12.11</a> also not applicable. Uploaded content is theirs &quot;in perpetuity and throughout the universe&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.12.')">12.12</a> also about user submissions to the website, which isn't applicable</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.13.')">12.13</a> if they think it is &quot;likely&quot; that you will submit bad content, they can do anything to &quot;cure&quot; that. E.g. if they see you post a strong political opinion online, they can cancel your account (without refund)</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.16.')">12.16</a> &quot;There may also be risks of dealing with ... international trade issues&quot;</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.19.')">12.19</a> they can refuse service for any reason</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.21.')">12.21</a> you have to tell them if you lose your phone or someone else gains access</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">12.23</a> they are not obliged to respond to any enquiries</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">12.23</a> headings in the terms are meaningless</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">12.23</a> they have no statue of limitations</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">12.23</a> makes no representation that the service is applicable or available or use outside the USA, despite Sydney and Brisbane being listed on <a href="https://www.li.me/locations">the website</a></p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.23.')">12.23</a> another right to discriminate</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.24.')">12.24</a> DMCA! For a bicycle hire company!</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.25.')">12.25</a> they can change the terms and your use is assumed to be an agreement. They just need to update the page linked in the app menu</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.25.5.')">12.25.5</a> you will read the whole terms and conditions each time you ride</p>
<p><a href="javascript:clauseShow('12.28.')">12.28</a> you are not in a &quot;terrorist supporting country&quot; - only if using iOS</p>
