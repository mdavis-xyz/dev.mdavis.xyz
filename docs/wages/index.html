      <p>When I showed my first payslip as a graduate to a graduate, we noticed that I am paid more than she is. We had both recently started the same role, at the same time, but I am male and she is female.</p>
<p>Most people do not let others see their payslips. How can we possibly hope to eliminate the gender pay gap if no one knows how much anyone else earns? (As well as the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/research-report-108-the-ethnicity-pay-gap.pdf">race</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21480734-dataclysm">attractiveness</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00239">height</a> pay gaps.)</p>
<h1 id="labour-market-efficiency">Labour Market Efficiency</h1>
<p>Let us first consider what companies are trying to achieve by paying more for some roles. Then I will demonstrate that wage transparency helps achieve these goals.</p>
<p>The reasons some roles have a higher pay are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those roles are more valuable or important; or</li>
<li>It is harder to find qualified people for those roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any job seeker will tell you that it is difficult to find out actual dollar figures for salaries until the end of the process when you receive an offer document to sign. This means that there is nothing steering workers towards the jobs which employers most value and most desperately need. Recruitment is a transaction on the labour market. Markets operate most efficiently when all the players see know all the prices. Imagine how poorly your local supermarket would perform if they removed all the price tags from their store. So how can businesses thrive if the labour market is inefficient? Price signals are worthless unless you broadcast that signal to the potential parties on the other side of the transaction.</p>
<p>I recently learned that a different co-worker of mine in the same role as me earns 8% more than I do, because he has a Master's degree and I only have a Bachelor's. Obviously this means that my employer finds Masters graduates more valuable and desirable than Bachelors graduates. I was already considering undertaking a Masters. Now that I know I will get paid more, I am <em>more likely</em> to do so, which means my employer is <em>more likely</em> to get that extra value which they seek. Therefore it is in the interest of the business to make this wage premium known to employees.</p>
<h1 id="well-informed-business-decisions">Well Informed Business Decisions</h1>
<p>While working in a business analyst role, I was once asked to predict project costs to within &#177;5%. Instead of being given a list of how much each person on the project actually costs the business, I was given a &quot;blended&quot; wage rate for each group of people. This means the numbers had an unnecessary error of &#177;10%. It is literally <em>impossible</em> to make a prediction to within &#177;5% using data which is only &#177;10%. Similarly, I was unable to tell the executives how much they were spending with any less than a &#177;10% uncertainty. How can a business thrive if wage secrecy means they cannot predict and track their spending accurately?</p>
<h1 id="ethics">Ethics</h1>
<p>For the case of my female co-worker being paid less, we eventually learned that there was a business justification for it. I was classed as a &quot;technical graduate&quot;, and she was classed as a &quot;non-technical graduate&quot;. Technical graduates are harder to acquire, so the market rate is higher. This means the difference in pay is ethically justifiable, however the secrecy is still unethical.</p>
<p>Consider the case of an employee awarding a large tender to a company owned by his brother. It sounds corrupt, but it may actually be the case that this company is indeed the best tender applicant. Most companies prohibit this behaviour, and they would give someone else the decision making power. This is because it is not enough that employees merely avoid <em>acting</em> corruptly. They must also be <em>seen</em> to not act corruptly, and <em>seen</em> to deal with conflicts of interest appropriately. For this same reason, it the factors behind pay differences should be <em>seen</em>.</p>
<h1 id="pay-gaps">Pay Gaps</h1>
<p>The gender pay gap thrives in secrecy. Many people reject the existence of the gap at all, claiming that if women were really paid less for the same role, then businesses would only ever hire women.</p>
<p>The problem with this claim is the assumption that companies never pay people different amounts for the same role and same experience. This is not true. Different people in identical roles are frequently paid different amounts, because of performance based pay. (Commissions, performance based pay rises, performance based bonuses, etc.) These are often based on human assessments which are subject to the same unconscious biases that can be found everywhere else in our society. This is one of the reasons why attractive women <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21480734-dataclysm">are paid more</a> than less attractive ones. The reviewer is simply more impressed, due to unconscious (or conscious) bias. The most effective way to mitigate this is wage transparency.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a company who pays technical graduates more than non-technical graduates. This employer believes that technical graduates are more valuable or in demand (compared to supply) than non-technical graduates. Females are under-represented in technical degrees and careers. Therefore this employer probably pays female graduates less than male graduates on average. This means the employer is contributing to societies overall gender pay gap, which is an undesirable side effect of a justifiable salary premium.</p>
<p>Paying non-technical graduates less is a sound ethical and business decision on its own. However because of the secrecy about this wage difference, female high school students trying to choose a university degree have no price signal from the labour market to incentivise them to study technical degrees. Similarly, females considering a career change have no price signal steering them towards the higher paying roles which employers most desperately seek. In this way wage secrecy harms women, businesses and society in general.</p>
<p>If employers and employees are open about their take-home-pay, the gender pay gap will decrease. The reduced under-representation will <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">make those businesses perform better</a>. The increase in labour market efficiency will mean that employers will more successfully attract the talent they seek into the roles they need.</p>
