      <h1>Hi</h1>
      <p>
         This page is used to track view counts to my page.
         Don't worry, it's nothing sinister.
         I don't even save your IP address, let alone anything else.

         Just "1 person loaded the page at this time".

         I deliberately do <i>not</i> use Google Analytics or anything invasive.
