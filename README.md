# My Website

This repo contains the content for [www.mdavis.xyz](www.mdavis.xyz).

I wrote the tooling for this many years ago, as my first front-end project. I didn't know much, so it's not really optimal. The tooling is a bit messy, not what I'd do if I started from scatch today. So if you're a potential employer checking out my work, please check out a different repo.

If you want to suggest an addition or correction for [Achievements of the Coalition Government](https://www.mdavis.xyz/govlist/)
click on the issues tab to raise a GitHub issue.

If you want to get a machine-readable copy of the dot points and links for that page,
look at `pages/govlist/abbott.yaml`.
If you want to see a history of the page changing over time, look at the git history of that file.
(Noting that it used to be called abbott.txt.)
